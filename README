# YVILAND

My attempt in creating a super mario bros-like game.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gwutz/yviland/master/out.gif)

## How to build

```
# ./configure
# make
```

## How to run

Currently its not possible to install the game system-wide because i hardcoded
some paths for development reasons.

```
# src/yviland
```
